## Development process

Starting with project 2, I decided to try and add some features and rebuild as an ember app.

Initially this seemed easier than I ultimately found it. Findig some struggles with getting each of the CRUD features working.
Create, delete, and read were easy. Struggling with update a bit. Stopping for some documentation and will try agian.
